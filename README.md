# README - DocAssist (Intelligent Medical Decision Support System)

## Project Overview
DocAssist is an intelligent medical decision support system designed to assist doctors in making informed treatment decisions based on patient data. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, this system provides personalized treatment recommendations based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, lab results, and other relevant factors.

## Project Objectives
- Collect and preprocess patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) and medical databases.
- Develop machine learning models to predict treatment outcomes.
- Generate personalized treatment recommendations for individual patients.
- Implement explainable AI techniques to enhance model interpretability.
- Design a user-friendly interface for doctors to input patient data and receive recommendations.

## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Libraries:
```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn flask xgboost
```

### Running the Code:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Open `Docassist.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, train models, and generate treatment recommendations.
4. Use the provided user interface to input patient details and view suggested treatments.

## Implementation Details
### 1. Data Collection
- Patient data is sourced from electronic health records (EHRs) and medical databases.
- Ensures compliance with healthcare privacy regulations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handles missing values, normalizes data, and removes noise.
- Sensitive patient information is anonymized and encrypted.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracts key features such as demographic details, medical history, diagnostic test results, and medication history.
- Transforms categorical variables into numerical representations for analysis.

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks.
- Models trained using preprocessed patient data to predict treatment outcomes.

### 5. Model Interpretability
- Feature importance techniques are implemented to explain model decisions.
- Visualizations help doctors understand treatment recommendations.

### 6. User Interface
- Designed an intuitive web interface using Flask.
- Allows doctors to input patient data and receive recommendations securely.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for model performance.
- Explainability through feature importance and visualization techniques.
- Feedback from doctors on usability and effectiveness.

## Future Enhancements
- Deploying the system as a web application.
- Incorporating real-time patient feedback to refine recommendations.
- Implementing deep learning for advanced decision-making.
